# Introduction to Typescript


# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript, making it easier to build large-scale applications while maintaining the flexibility and power of JavaScript.
